# Google IT Automation
 A collection of my code solutions for the course [Automating Real-World Tasks with Python](https://www.coursera.org/learn/automating-real-world-tasks-python/home/welcome) of the [Google IT Automation with Python Certification](https://www.coursera.org/professional-certificates/google-it-automation?utm_source=googleit&utm_medium=institutions&utm_campaign=gwgsite), hosted by Coursera.

## Contents
The final course is made by 4 labs to challenge you and put the skills you earned during the other courses in practice.  
The labs are:
1. [Scale and convert images using PIL](https://github.com/marco97pa/Google-IT-Automation/blob/main/1%20-%20Scale%20and%20convert%20images%20using%20PIL/Introduction.md)
2. [Process text files and upload to a Web Service](https://github.com/marco97pa/Google-IT-Automation/blob/main/2%20-%20Process%20text%20files%20and%20upload%20to%20a%20Web%20Service/Introduction.md)
3. [Automatically Generate a PDF and send it by Email](https://github.com/marco97pa/Google-IT-Automation/blob/main/3%20-%20Automatically%20Generate%20a%20PDF%20and%20send%20it%20by%20Email/Introduction.md)
4. [Automate updating catalog information](https://github.com/marco97pa/Google-IT-Automation/blob/main/4%20-%20Automate%20updating%20catalog%20information/Introduction.md) (Final test)


## Disclaimer
The code is provided "AS IS".  
It could be improved and optimized since I written it during the exams, with short time frame, so it can be "rough around the edges".

This code is provided as an educational support.  
It works but **I highly discourage to copy-paste** or clone this repository during the exams: you fool yourself and you loss an important occasion to learn and it is against the Coursera Honor Code.

## How to use it
There are four directories, one for each exam.  
They contains not only the solutions code, but also all the support code and file provided by Google for each lab.  
Each directory contains an `Introduction.md` file with details about the scope of each lab.

## About the certification
I think this is a great certification: I learnt A LOT and I discovered Python, Cloud, system administration and more.  

While I was learning I made a side project called [Most Subscribed YouTube Music Channels](https://github.com/marco97pa/MostSubYTMusicChannels): a bot written in Python and running in the cloud that posts on Twitter the last updates about the most subscribed artist on YouTube.  
This side project helped me a lot as a "training" during each course.
